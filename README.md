# Industrial-Robotics-Course
In this project several tasks has been accomplished in terms of robot manipulator control in MATLAB/Simulink and autonomous mapping and navigation in ROS.
Task1: Plan straight and circular trajectory in workspace and calculate robot manipulability
Task2: PD and gravity compensation (workspace)
Task3: Inverse Dynamics control
Task4: Robust Inverse Dynamics Control
Task5: PD and gravity compensation (jointspace)
Task6: Pose control of end-effector in workspace

Ros Tasks:
Task1: Spawn turtlebot3 into the gazebo environment
Task2: Autonomously map the environment using wall following algorithm
Task3: Autonomously navigate the created environment
